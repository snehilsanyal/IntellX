# Guidelines


## For team

1. Useful links: 
- [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/snehilsanyal/IntellX/issues) 
- Slack Channel
- Jira tickets
- Projects/Tasks GitHub

2. **Everyone works on their remote branch and create PR for their code to be merged, nobody pushes directly to main**

- Branch name: <user_name>_dev (same as that in the server to avoid confusions)
- PR template mentions issues and tags assignees
- Admin does code review and merges PR

## For contributors (future)

Aim: Contributors can fork the repo and help in features, raising issues


1. Good PR practices:
- Read [this](https://github.blog/2015-01-21-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request/) blog


2. Issues:
- Issue labels: `bug`, `feature-enhancement`, `good-first-issue`, `documentation`
- Documentation (Will have a documentation page hosted using Sphinx or some AutoDoc
example: [LangChain Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html))
- Misc 

3. Discussions:
